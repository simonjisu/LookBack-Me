# Study Plans In 2019

- [x] PRML study
    - Object: Study basic machine learning theory, lay the ground work : "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" - Christopher Bishop
    - Progress(10%): Only Stuided 4 Chapters. This may be a long long project 

- [x] Keep on NLP Paper reading & implementation
    - BERT
    - Transformer

- [x] Try to Learn New Things
    - flask: nope
    - spark: only installed
    - reinforment learning: maybe 2 days...?
